🔹 I'm a B.Tech student specializing in CSE (AI & ML) under MAKAUT University, and I love combining artificial intelligence with fullstack web development to build meaningful tech solutions.

One interesting fact about my journey – I built Wander Lust, a fullstack Airbnb-like web app, and earned a spot in the Top 25 at OpenSource Apertre 2.0, all while contributing actively to open source projects. These experiences helped me grow beyond tutorials and dive into real-world problem-solving with tech.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies I work with:

MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

Python, Java, C

SQL, MongoDB

Git & GitHub

💡 Domains of Interest:

Fullstack Web Development

AI/ML Projects

Backend Systems

Data Analytics

EdTech & Healthcare Solutions

🌱 I'm passionate about learning in public and contributing to the tech community through open source. I’m always exploring new ways to merge code with creativity to solve real problems. If you're building something cool or want to collaborate, let’s connect!
